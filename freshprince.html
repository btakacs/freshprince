		<h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>

		<p>From western Philadelphia I hail
		where in my youth I'd play upon the green
		'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd
		by ruffians contemptible and mean.
		Although the spat was trivial and brief,
		it wounded my dear mother deep within;
		and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,
		she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.
		When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,
		I came upon a coachman most unique;
		and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,
		despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.
		I survey all the land with princely mien
		in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.</p>

		<p> Here's the Full Lyric in English:</p>
		
		<p>Now, this is a story all about how
		My life got flipped-turned upside down
		And I'd like to take a minute
		Just sit right there
		I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air</p>

		<p>In west Philadelphia born and raised
		n the playground was where I spent most of my days
		Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
		And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
		When a couple of guys who were up to no good
		Started making trouble in my neighborhood
		I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
		She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'</p>

		<p>I begged and pleaded with her day after day
		But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way
		She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
		I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.</p>

		<p>First class, yo this is bad
		Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
		Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
		Hmmmmm this might be alright.</p>

		<p>But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
		Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
		I don't think so
		I'll see when I get there
		I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air</p>

		<p>Well, the plane landed and when I came out
		There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
		I ain't trying to get arrested yet
		I just got here
		I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared</p>

		<p>I whistled for a cab and when it came near
		The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
		If anything I could say that this cab was rare
		But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, home to Bel Air'</p>

		<p>I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
		And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo home smell ya later'
		I looked at my kingdom
		I was finally there
		To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air</p>
